### Module 4 Challenge: Coding Quiz

## Challenge Description:
This challenge asked for a JavaScript coding quiz that would keep track of highscores.

## Functionality:
The quiz features two pages.
The main page features a timed quiz.
Making an incorrect answer will subtract time and and points from a users score.
Once all questions are answered or time runs out, the user will be asked to enter initials and submit.
Then the users score is submitted and they are presented with retake and highscore buttons.
The highscore button will take the user to the separate highscore page, which displays all highscores from local storage and allows the user to reset the highscores.
